# Third-Party Integrations
In many enterprise scenarios, you may need to integrate data collected by Print Tracker with other systems such as your ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) solution. Print Tracker provides integrations with several ERP solutions today, with the ability to integrate out-of-the box with any system that supports emailed CSV reports. You can even create your own custom integrations using our REST API!

## ERP Systems {#erp-systems}
### E-Automate {#e-automate}
Because E-Automate is the most popular ERP system amount enterprise MPS users, we've developed a native integration with E-Automate that automatically pushes Print Tracker meters based on your [billing schedules](./20-configuring-settings.md#schedule). It also synchronizes equipment numbers from E-Automate into Print Tracker so that you can easily work with the devices between the two systems.

This integration is powered by the **Print Tracker Data Processor**, an application that is installed on-premise and is compatible with self-hosted E-Automate, or cloud-hosted E-Automate.

### Miracle Service {#miracle-service}
Miracle Service supports ingesting meter data via emailed CSV files. You can create a [custom report](./reports) and [schedule](./reports#scheduling-reports) it to be emailed to Miracle Service.

## Auto-fulfillment {#auto-fulfillment}
### Supplies Network {#supplies-network}
Print Tracker has a seamless integration with Supplies Network, a leading consumable auto-fulfillment supplier. Once the integration is enabled, Print Tracker will automatically push your meters to Supplies Network, where they will analyze the meters to estimate the best time to ship replacement supplies.

Enabling the supplies network integration requires some co-ordination between your Print Tracker account and your Supplies Network account. Please contact our support team to get started.

## Pricing {#pricing}
Integrations that require the use of an API-key such as the [Print Tracker Data Processor](#e-automate) or any custom integrations using the [REST API](#rest-api) incur additional charges which will appear on your monthly invoice.

> API keys are billed at $50 per 50 GB of data transfer, per month, per entity with at least one API key.

In order to understand how API keys are billed, let's explore a few examples:

| Scenario                                                                                                                                                         | Bill                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| You create an API key at your dealer-entity. You pull 10GB of data each month.                                                                                   | $50 x 1 entity with at least one API key = **$50/mo**                                      |
| You create an API key at your dealer-entity. You pull 51GB of data each month.                                                                                   | $50 x 1 entity with at least one API key * 2 blocks of 50GB of data transfer = **$100/mo** |
| You create two API keys at your dealer-entity, one for production, and one for your developers. You pull 10GB of data between the two API keys each month.       | $50 x 1 entity with at least one API key = **$50/mo**                                      |
| You create an API key at your dealer-entity, and another API key for one of your customers at your customer's entity. You pull 10GB of combined data each month. | $50 x 2 entities with at least one API key = **$100/mo**                                   |
