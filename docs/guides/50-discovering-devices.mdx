# Discovering and Managing Devices
Print Tracker's primary purpose is to discover your devices and collect [meters](./60-meters-and-supplies.md) from those devices. Once discovered, you can view and manage your devices remotely from anywhere in the world. Managing your devices includes configuring device settings, cleaning up old devices, reviewing device statistics, and more.

## Discovering Devices {#discovering-devices}
The process of discovering devices on your network involves scanning every IP address to detect whether there's a printer located at that address. By default, Print Tracker will periodically scan your network automatically to discover new devices. You can also manually trigger a scan at any time. 

### On-demand Scans {#on-demand-scans}
![](https://www.cdn.printtrackerpro.com/images/documentation/discovering-devices-scan-for-device.gif)

To manually scan your network for devices:
1. Using the side navigation bar, click **Devices > View devices**
2. In the top-right corner, click **Scan for devices**
3. Enter the IP address, range, network, or CIDR block you want to scan
   :::info
   This field supports values formatted as:
   * Individual IP addresses (`10.0.0.1`)
   * Range of IP addresses (`10.0.0.1-10`)
   * A single subnet using a wild card (`10.0.0.*`)
   * A [CIDR notated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) network (`10.0.0.1/24`)
   :::
4. Click **Add devices**
5. If there are multiple installs at this entity, select the installs that you want to run the scan from
6. Click **Confirm**

If the install is online, it will immediately begin scanning the network for devices. If the install is offline, the scan will begin the next time the install comes online.

#### Viewing Scan Progress {#viewing-scan-progress}
![](https://www.cdn.printtrackerpro.com/images/documentation/discovering-devices-scan-job.gif)

To view the progress of the scan:
1. Using the sidebar, click **Jobs > View**
2. Click on the job named **Custom Scan**

You can view the progress of the scan as well as the logs produced by the install during the scan.

## Managing Devices {#managing-devices}
It's important to maintain your fleet in Print Tracker, for example, if you move devices from one location to another (from one contract to another) it's important to [disable](#enablingdisabling-devices) or [remove](removing-devices) the old device from Print Tracker. This is especially true if you're using a 3rd part integration like the [E-Automate data processor](./110-third-party-integrations.mdx#e-automate).

### Enabling/Disabling Devices {#enablingdisabling-devices}
In some cases, Print Tracker may have discovered devices that you don't want to manage, and don't want to pay for in Print Tracker. These non-managed devices will continue to upload meter reads once per quarter. Non-managed devices offer an inexpensive way to get periodic snapshots throughout the year of your devices.

<VideoPlayer url="https://www.cdn.printtrackerpro.com/images/documentation/discovering-devices-disable-devices.mp4"/>

To disable a device.
1. Using the side navigation bar, click **Devices > View devices**
2. Select the devices you want to disable by click the checkboxes next to the devices
3. At the top of the column, click the drop-down arrow
4. Click **Disable selected**

To enable a device.
1. Using the side navigation bar, click **Devices > View devices**
2. Select the devices you want to disable by click the checkboxes next to the devices
3. At the top of the column, click the drop-down arrow
4. Click **Enable selected**

### Removing Devices {#removing-devices}
:::caution Warning
Don't remove devices that are still on the network. Print Tracker may rediscover the devices next time it runs a network scan. Consider [disabling the device](#enablingdisabling-devices) instead.
:::

Remove devices that are no longer on the network, and that you don't care about seeing.

<VideoPlayer url="https://www.cdn.printtrackerpro.com/images/documentation/discovering-devices-removing-devices.mp4"/>

To remove a device.
1. Using the side navigation bar, click **Devices > View devices**
2. Select the devices you want to disable by click the checkboxes next to the devices
3. At the top of the column, click the drop-down arrow
4. Click **Remove selected**

## Non-Managed Devices {#non-managed-devices}
Non-managed devices are devices free of charge, but only upload meters once per quarter. Non-managed devices are useful for getting periodic snapshots of your fleet throughout the year for devices where you don't need alerts, or frequent meter reads. See [Enabling/Disabling Devices](#enablingdisabling-devices) for more information.
